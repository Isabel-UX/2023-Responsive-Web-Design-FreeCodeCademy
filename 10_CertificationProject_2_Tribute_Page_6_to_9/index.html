                <h3>Who is Pingu?</h3>
                <p>He's a charming and cheeky young penguin who lives in the snow and ice of the South Pole. Often finding himself in tricky and comical situations, the mischievous penguin meets the challenges of life head on, as he grows into a cooler and wiser penguin along the way. The award-winning, stop-frame claymotion show appeals to millions of fans worldwide. Pingu has fun chillin' with his family and friends at their Arctic home, but that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the cool adventures of this humorous penguin. Penguins have feelings too, and Pingu experiences the joys and frustrations of kids everywhere in these fun-filled stories. But sometimes things get out of hand as the mischievous little penguin goes from one "ice-capade" to another!</p>
